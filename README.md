## 🎯 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data to understand the drivers of attrition. The goal is to identify patterns related to demographics, job satisfaction, and departmental trends to help develop effective employee retention strategies.

## 💾 Data Sources
The analysis is based on the `HR Data.csv` file, which contains 1,470 employee records with attributes like age, department, job role, satisfaction scores, and attrition status.

## 🛠️ Tools
*   **Excel:** For initial data cleaning and preparation.
*   **Tableau:** For creating an interactive dashboard and visualizing the data.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA focused on answering key questions to uncover attrition patterns:

*   What is the overall attrition rate?
*   Which department has the highest number of employees leaving?
*   Is there a correlation between age, gender, or job role and attrition?
*   How does job satisfaction impact an employee's decision to leave?

## 📈 Results/Findings
The analysis revealed several key insights:

*   The overall attrition rate for the company stands at **16.1%**.
*   The **Research & Development** department has the highest number of employees leaving, followed by **Sales**.
*   Attrition is most common among employees in the **25-34 age group**.
*   Employees working **overtime** are significantly more likely to leave the company.

## ✅ Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

*   Conduct targeted exit interviews within the R&D department to understand specific pain points.
*   Review workload and overtime policies, especially for younger employees, to improve work-life balance.
*   Develop tailored engagement and development programs for high-attrition job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.
